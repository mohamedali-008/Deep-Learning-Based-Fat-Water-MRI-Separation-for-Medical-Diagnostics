## Overview

This project applies deep learning techniques to separate fat and water signals in MRI images using the Three-Point Dixon method. By leveraging TensorFlow and neural networks, the model enhances medical imaging for improved diagnostic accuracy, particularly in detecting conditions related to fat distribution in organs such as the liver, brain, and heart.

## Features

- **Advanced Medical Image Processing**:
  - Implementation of the **Three-Point Dixon method** for MRI fat/water separation
  - Deep learning models trained for accurate medical image reconstruction
  - Optimization techniques for artifact reduction and enhanced imaging
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**:
  - Image correction for **B0 field inhomogeneities**
  - Feature extraction and transformation for improved deep learning model performance
  - Efficient handling of MRI datasets using `pandas` and `numpy`
- **Healthcare Industry Applications**:
  - AI-driven **MRI-based fat and water imaging** for medical diagnosis
  - Automated detection of conditions such as **fatty liver disease and cardiac disorders**
  - Enhancement of MRI scan quality for clinical decision-making
